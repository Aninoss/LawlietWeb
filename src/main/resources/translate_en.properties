#FAQ
faq.0.question = How can I use Lawliet?
faq.0.answer = It´s very simple! Just invite the bot into your server. After that, write "L.help" in order to open a menu where you can browse every command Lawliet has to offer, including explanations and examples.
faq.1.question = What permissions does Lawliet require in order to work properly?
faq.1.answer = The bot always needs to be able to read and write messages and to embed links, some commands might require more than that. If you try to execute a command even though the bot is missing the required permissions, then you will get notified.
faq.2.question = Command executions should only be allowed in certain channels, how can I do that?
faq.2.answer = Just run the command "L.whitelist". There you can specify the channels in which your server members should be able to execute bot commands. All other channels will be excluded.
faq.3.question = How can I turn off NSFW commands?
faq.3.answer = You don´t need to do that. All nsfw commands can only be run on channels that are marked as nsfw. If you don´t have any channels like that, then it will be impossible to execute the nsfw commands.
faq.4.question = "The role/s x can not be managed due to missing permissions!"
faq.4.answer = This basically means that the bot is unable to manage your specified roles. In order to solve the issue, you need to go to the server settings and move all of the corresponding roles below the Lawliet role.
faq.5.question = Why don´t I get any fish in the fishery?
faq.5.answer = The bot uses several mechanisms in order to prevent spamming as best as possible. If you happen to get no fish, then the anti spam protection might be the reason. Just go on as usual and the bot will soon start to give you fish again.
faq.6.question = How can I report bugs?
faq.6.answer = If you find any bugs, please report them in the Lawliet support server, so the developer can look into them and fix them.
faq.7.question = Do you accept commissions for personal Discord bots?
faq.7.answer = Most probably, yes. Just join the Lawliet suppert server and place your commission in the support channel. You will soon receive an answer from the developer.
